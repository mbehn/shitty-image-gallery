# My shitty image gallery
Thank you for checking out my shitty image gallery javascript Object thing. 
- Trust me, it's terrible. 
- Fuck you, it works 
- Go make your own shitty gallery or steal one you ``ass ``
- 
## What does it do?
- Takes the images that come with the repository and makes a shitty image gallery with left and right navigation that fuckin works. 
- It also takes a fancy data-description object from the images and places it above, like a description. Fuckin cool shit. 

## What does it not do?
- I doubt it will work with any images other than what come with the repository. Or images of that size. I think its like 480px. 
- It's not responsive
- Follow any basic logic

Have any questions? I probably won't answer.
